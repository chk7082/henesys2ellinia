# About this project

Henesys and ellinia are two of the most popular cities in maple world. And both cities have their own styles.

Think about particular henesys map. What would this map look like if it were in ellinia? (or in the opposite direction)

Our goal is image-to-image translation between cities in maple world.

But here's the problem, there's no (henesys_city, ellinia_city) pair which have same structure. (i.e we don't have paired dataset)

We will use [CycleGAN](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/) to deal with this unpaired image-to-image translation task.
